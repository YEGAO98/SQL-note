From the speaker table, recode the price column into a categorical column called price_level. For prices lower than 100, we consider them as low. For prices higher than 1000, we consider them as high. The rest would be medium.

-- speaker
|   model                             |   price  |
|-------------------------------------|----------|
|   Bowers & Wilkins Formation Wedge  |   899    |
|   Bang & Olufsen Beosound Balance   |   2250   |
|   Xiaomi Mi Smart Speaker HD        |   50     |

### **ANSWER**
SELECT model,price,
      **WRONG**:  *price < 100 AS 'low'
        price > 1000 AS 'high'
       price between 100 and 1000 'medium'
       price_l*
      **CORRECT** CASE WHEN price < 100 THEN 'low'
       WHEN price > 1000 THEN 'high'
       ELSE 'medium'
       END AS price_level 
FROM speaker;
